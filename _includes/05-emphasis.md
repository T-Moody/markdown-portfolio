One of my best __attributes__ is __persistence__. I am not the type of person to _give up_ when I do not understand something. I do my __research__ and __adapt__ to the situation. One __Computer Science skill__ that I am getting good at is working with the __Java programming language__. I am in my second __Java__ class now and I am learning a lot. I am also getting pretty comfortable with __Python__, but that _language_ is stll pretty _new_ to me.
